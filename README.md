# Welcome to the Ghana Digital Address Route Finder
<hr>
This is a simple application built based on Ghana's digital addressing system. I had the idea one day 
that it would be interesting to search for routes and locations on a map using the addressing system
just like we do for locations we know. This is a hobby project prototyped over the course of three days.

In terms of usability, it's probably easier to stick to the map you're used to for a number of reasons which I
list in the article accompanying this project (see link below).
Regardless, this was quite an interesting project to explore.

More details about Ghana's digital addressing system and this project can be found [here]().

A link to the working prototype of the application can be found [here]() as well. I offer no guarantees 
that the link will always be functional whenever you try to access it.
