# Welcome to the Ghana Digital Address Route Finder
<hr>
This is a simple application built based on Ghana's digital addressing system. I had the idea one day 
that it would be interesting to search for routes and locations on a map using the addressing system
just like we do for locations we know. This is a hobby project prototyped over the course of three days.

In terms of usability, it's probably easier to stick to the map you're used to for a number of reasons which I
list in the article accompanying this project (see link below).
Regardless, this was quite an interesting project to explore.

More details about this project can be found in my article [here](https://excel-chukwu.netlify.app/2022/11/06/building-a-ghana-digital-address-route-finder/).

A link to the working prototype of the application can be found [here]() as well. I offer no guarantees 
that the link will always be functional whenever you try to access it.
