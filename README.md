## Update

With the loss of the Heroku free tier offerings, the GhanaPostGPS API server is now offline. I will try to deploy my own instance when I have the time. Please view the article on my website (linked below) to understand more about how this application was built.


# Welcome to the Ghana Digital Address Route Finder

<hr>

This is a simple application built based on Ghana's digital addressing system. It occurred to me that it would be interesting to search for routes and locations on a map using the addressing system just like we do for locations we know, so I set out to build a prototype of the idea. Due to time constraints and this being a hobby project, I built this out fairly quickly.

In terms of usability, it's probably easier for the regular map user to stick to the way of searching they're used to for a number of reasons which I list in the article accompanying this project (see link below). Regardless, this was quite an interesting project to explore, and could be quite useful for logistics and shipping purposes.

More details about this project can be found in my article [here](https://excel-chukwu.netlify.app/2022/11/06/building-a-ghana-digital-address-route-finder/).

To try out the project:

- go to the specified application link above
- enter a source address (e.g. `AK4849321`) and a destination address (e.g. `GA-183-8164`) 
- click the `Search` button

The map should now refresh with routes from the location represented by the source address to the location represented by the destination address.
